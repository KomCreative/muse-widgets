# muse-widgets

These are some widgets for Adobe Muse that I wrote for my own use. They are based on wep apps, scripts and plugins written by individuals with far more talent that me, so many thanks to the authors that made these widgets possible. They help me add serious value to the sites I build for my clients. For help, questions, ideas or suggestions, please contact me on www.Komcreative.com.
